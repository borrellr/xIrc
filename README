xIrc-2.3.9 - Robert Borrell <robert.borrell@gmail.com>
==========
This release is a modified version of 2.3.8 that has been ported to Qt3.
See installation page for more details on how to build the binary.
This release has some known issues such as the server list in the table is
not sorted.

xIrc-2.3.8 - Robert Borrell <borrell@pobox.com>
==========
This release requires the use of Qt Widget library version 2.2.4. Other minor
enhancements have been made.

xIrc-2.3.7 - Robert Borrell <borrell@pobox.com>
==========
This release has been ported to SuSE Linux 7.0.  Further development on the
Solaris platform has been dropped.  Starting with xIrc-2.3.6, the xIrc program
requires the use of QT 2.1.1 Widget library.

xIrc-2.3.4 - Robert Borrell <borrell@pobox.com>
==========
This release has been ported to qt-2.x platform.  I want to thank Christian
Poulter for his contribution.  Otherwise there has a few bug fixes in this
release.

xIrc-2.3 - Robert Borrell <borrell@pobox.com>
==========
This release has been ported to qt-1.44 for linux systems and SUN Solaris
systems using gcc-2.95.2.

xIrc-2.2p1
==========
This release offers Colors!!!  There have  also been a few bugs fixed  and 
the File Dialog used in  DCC transfers has  been worked on  to make a  bit 
more  sense  than  before.   It  still  probably  leaves  some  room   for 
improvement though.  

The other big change that I have made is that I've changed the defaults so 
that the program comes up closer to  the way it looks in the screen  shots 
than before.  Forgive me for this in the past.  I didn't even think to see 
how it looked using the defaults for about a year or more.  Was I  shocked 
at how ugly it looked!  Now the only difference between thetwo is the font 
I use here at home is  'Lucidabrite'  font  for  the  default  family  and 
'Lucidatypewriter' for the  message windows and  their input fields.   Are 
the Lucida fonts standard?  

You will find that there is  now  a  users  guide  in  xIrc.dvi,  xIrc.ps, 
xIrc.doc.  Take your choice of formats.  The xIrc.doc file is plain  ASCII 
for those of you with very limited text abilities.  I highly recommend the 
others as this file  is not  very pretty.   It was  derived from  xIrc.dvi 
using dvi2tty.  As handy as  this  program  is,  it  doesn't  (and  I  can 
understand why) handle  going from  a proportional  font to  a fixed  font 
format very well.  It also does not handle '_' at all well, they come  out 
as '='.  Therefore, in  the names for the  tags in the xIrc.default  file, 
substitute '_' where you see aa '='.   In a pinch the ASCII file beats  no 
documentation at all.  For  you who are  brave at heart  and have alot  of 
disk space, I provided xIrc.tex  so that  if you  run 'Make  doc' it  will 
create the  various  documents  using  latex  and  dvi2tty  programs.   My 
personal preference at this point has been xdvi for viewing purposes.   It 
has much cleaner fonts  and in  my humble  opinion looks  alot nicer  than 
ghost-view.  Mind you  I  like  and  use  ghost-view,  but  if  I  had  my 
druthers...  

Description:
============

xIrc is as the name implies, and IRC Client program that runs under X.  It 
is written in C++ and  the binary for it  provided was compiled using c++ 
2.95.2 and Qt-2.2.4.   See  the  INSTALL  document provided for details on
building it if  you need or  desire too, have  no fear, it's reasonably
easy to build.

Known Bugs:

The servers.dat must be in place where the X resources are set for it to 
be. If it is not, you will not be able connect to a server! See INSTALL
for details on where to put it.

The message Query Box, the one that informs you of an incomming private 
message, does not resize properly. Kind of pointless to make it do so 
since at this point the line buffers for the multiline windows don't get 
reformated to make the lines of text fit the new window's size.

Speeking of this, none of message windows reformat the text to properly 
fit the windows new size when resized. New text will be proper formatted 
though. This could prove to be a nightmare to fix because of how I 
implimented the multiline windows so it probably won't be fixed in the 
next few releases.

If you attempt to send a 0 length file with DCC you will get a message box
letting you know and the transfer will be canceled. The bug is that if I
close the file, for some reason the application exits. Therefore, each time
this occurs, one more file descripter is left open. Enough of these and you
will run out of file desctripters.

To make a new entry to the notification or ignore lists take hold, you 
must 'save' the list the re-'load' it. Use the default names given in the 
file dialogs.
 
I believe there may be a problem where you MUST have something in the Nick 
and Address field of the notification & ignore tables even if the field is 
not used for the test.  Anything will do even a '.'.
