Installation Notes:

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------
On Windows 10, the following:

- Install VMWare Player (see www.vmware.com for details).
  Alternatively you can use a different virtual machine product.
- Install GitHub Desktop and WinSCP.
- Download the CentOSv4.8 ISOs and perform an install.  Ensure that you install
  all required development tools (gcc, g++, qt-3.3, qt-3.3-devel, qmake and
  required dependencies) NOTE: CentOSv4 does not come with git client.


SOURCE CODE install path
------------------------
- Use the GitHub Desktop to checkout the xIrc source code from
  http://github.com/borrellr/xIrc/
- Use the GitHub Desktop to checkout the libX++ source code from
  http://github.com/borrellr/libX++/
- Using WinScp transfer the source into CentOS system into working directory.
- Set the environment variable QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-3.3.3 (for CentOSv4).
- First build the libX++.so.1.0.0. Run qmake, which should create the Makefile.
  Run make.  If successful, it will create the libX++.so.1.0.0 along with its
  link files. 
- As root on create the /usr/local/lib/xIrc directory. Copy the servers.dat and
  xIrc.defaults file in /usr/local/lib/xIrc.
- Copy the libX++.so.1.0.0 into /usr/local/lib/xIrc. Create the links from
  libX++.so.1.0.0 to libX++.so.1.0, libX++.so.1, and libX++.so. Copy the the
  xIrc.conf to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ directory and run ldconfig.
- In the working xIrc directory, run qmake to create the Makefile. Run make.
  If successful, you should have a working xIrc binary.

CUSTOMIZATIONS
----------------
You can create your own customizations in your home directory.  With .servers
you can have own custom irc servers.  Using a colon as the separator, the
required fields are group, country, state, city, server, and ports.  You can
have more than one port listed, which is comma separated.  For example:

EFNet:USA:AZ:Phoenix:irc.primenet.com:6667 

In the .xIrc directory, you can have your own custom variables in the
xIrc.defaults file.  The entries are simple as demonstrated in following:

nicks= Rhys JohnConner Terminator JohnHenry
channels= #centos #qt #chatzone
