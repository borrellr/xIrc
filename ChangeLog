   operation of the program.  

-------------------------------------------------------
    2.1 ---> 2.2
-------------------------------------------------------

   Made major changes to the default values of the X-Resources. Now xIrc

   at the web site. 
   
   Fixed Close button on Channel Nick Window.

   Re-organized the sources to place the libX++ directory into the xIrc directory
   and simplified the build proccess.

-------------------------------------------------------
    2.0 ---> 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------

   Added DCC File send and receive functionality.

   Fixed AWAY/UNAWAY once and for all!

   Added beeps for DCC file/chat and private message notifications.
   
   Fixed the Nick Actions dialog to raise to the surface when activated.

   Modified the Channel Nick Dialog to open the Nick Actions Dialog on 
   double clicking a nick instead of opening the Channels & People dialog.

   Sets YOUR current 'Nick' in the caption of the main window.

   Modified the "Folks Online" list (Notifications) to be resizable.

   Fixed notifications to be case insensitive.
   
   Made the showing of CTCP responses (version, time, finger) show the 
   nick. (I still need to figure out a means to place these on the window
   that they were sent from).
   
   Parting from a channel should now be reflected in the main window

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.19 ---> 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------

   Replaced the buttons on the main window with menus.

   Added Notification and Ignore lists. These lists will now allow for 
   notifications of the arrival and departure of individuals, and the
   ability to ignore individuals.

   Created the classes xIrcMsgDispatch and xIrcMsgDispatchEntry. These classes
   are responsible for sending out commands to the server then accepting thier 
   responses and making sure the response is dispatched to the sender of the 
   message.
   
   Modified most of the code to send outgoing commands through xIrcMessageDispatch.

   Now the responses of most commands will be displayed in the window that the
   command was entered in. This does not include the ctcp commands such as ping.

   Modified xIrcConnect class to steer all responses to xIrcMessageDispatch
   to be dispatched appropriatly.

   Moved the resource initialization strings of all of the xIrc specific
   widgets to xIrc.cpp. Added the tag 'XIRC' to the start of all of them.
   This forces the tags in the external databases to have this tag also.

   Changed the message Query to use the QMultiLineEdit widget. This 
   eliminates the multiple new message queries from the same nick.

   Changed the default colors of the buttons to be darker than the windows
   default background color. Also forced the buttons to use a Bold typeface
   if the font supports it.

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.18 ---> 1.19
-------------------------------------------------------

   Changed to accept xIrc.defaults in the current directory to .xIrc in the
   home directory for the defaults file. If latter is not found, the first is 
   looked for.

   Rewrote     xIrcServerQuery    and    added    xServerTable,
   xIrcServerList,    xIrcServerEntry,    xIrcServerList,   and
   xIrcConnectDialog  to  facilitate  using  and manipulating a
   seperate  file  for  selecting servers. This also allows for
   importing mIrc server files.

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.17 ---> 1.18
-------------------------------------------------------

   Mostly made changes to support Dcc File transfers. This feature is
   currently disabled though because it's still quite unstable.

   Hopefully it now handles keyed channels. Not being one to go on them, or
   even know which ones are keyed, it's hard to test the patch. BTW, Thanks
   go to Franklin Robert Belew <frb@isc.umr.edu> for the patches!!!

   Finaly got around to using xMessage instead of QMessage so the 
   error messages and what not come up in the proper font :)).

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.16 ---> 1.17
-------------------------------------------------------

   Hmmm... I do have to do better....

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.15 ---> 1.16
-------------------------------------------------------

   Added the /LINKS and /MAP commands for what they are worth.

   Modified to handle the new xSocket API

   Replaced Popup dialog boxes for errors and replaced them w/ text
   messages in the main window untill I find the cause of the
   segmentation faults. This also include the showing of the server
   selection dialog box on the socket disconnecting.

   Fixed xIrcDccChatFrame to show actions properly.

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.14 ---> 1.15
-------------------------------------------------------

   Added X-Resources for configuration.
   Created a bitmap for the application.
   Hopefully fixed a few bugs and not instilled too many new ones!

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.13 ---> 1.14
-------------------------------------------------------

   '\'  is  now the continuation character for the xIrc.defaults file,
   not  '/'!!!  Already  existing  files  must  be fixed otherwise the
   program WILL bomb!!! See libX++/CHANGES

   Fixed xIrcMessageFrame to use the nick in the Nick List edit window
   before  it  uses  the selected nick in the list. What this means to
   the  user  is that they can type a nick into the edit window of the
   nick list and act upon it even if a nick is already selected in the
   list.

   Modified   xIrc.cpp   to   Open   the   Server   Dialog   (via  the
   xIrcConnect::newServer() member function) after selecting the nick.

   Fixed  the  replies to the /names command when used for an existing
   command  to  be  displayed  to  the screen when the nick box is not
   visible.

   Fixed the replies to both the /names and /list commands to show the
   channel name or nick when displayed on the main window. This is how
   one  would  expect  them  to  behave if a window is not open to the
   channel.

   Fixed  the  "Give  Ops"  and  "Take Ops" buttons on the Nick Action
   Dialog. They now work properly.

   Added the following buttons to the Nick Action Dialog,
      "Who", "Ban".

   Added a Dialog box for doing Bans. This uses the optional parameter
   BANMESSAGE for the kick message if a kick is performed w/ the ban.

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.12 ---> 1.13
-------------------------------------------------------

   Fixed  the Nick, Channel and Server Dialog boxes to work a bit more
   like  one would expect them to. If an item is selected and the edit
   field is blank, the selected item will be chosen.

   Moved  the  Initial  Nick  Query  to  the  main line code AFTER the
   xIrcConnect  object  is  constructed. The outward effect of this is
   that  the  main  window  will  be  displayed then the query will be
   shown.

   Added  a  'Nick  Action'  Dialog.  by  double  Clicking  on  a word
   (Presumably  a Nick) in a window, this dialog will be brought up w/
   both  the  nick and the window names already filled so that various
   actions may be done.

   Added  'Nick  Actions' buttons to the top of the widows to bring up
   the Nick Action Box w/o double clicking on a nick.

   Added a 'Nick List' button to the windows for channels to allow the
   hiding / showing of the nick list box.

   Modified  the  Nick  Selection  Dialog box to allow for alternative
   nicks.  It now also has a "Auto Nick Selection" button to allow the
   names  to be tried automaticaly if the last one tried is already in
   use.

   Changed  the  NICK tag in the defaults file to NICKS. NICK is still
   allowed  but  carries  a  stiff  warning  because  next  release it
   probably won't be.

   Added  the  tags REALNAME and EMAIL_ADDR to the xIrc.defaults file.
   See README.txt for details.

   Added a 'Close' button to the nick list for channels.

   Divided xIrcConnect.cpp into three files, xIrcConnect[1-3].cpp.

   Fixed  the  Makefile dependency part to include the header files of
   libX++.
   
-------------------------------------------------------
    1.11 ---> 1.12
-------------------------------------------------------

   Fixed  References  to  include  files requiring the /usr/include/qt
   link to not be required any longer

   Made the xIrcConnect widget default colors more palatable

   Corrected type casting to compile w/ the gcc-2.7.2 compiler

   Corrected  the  test for socket connection failure to look for TRUE
   or FALSE instead of < 0

   Removed  the 2 calls to show() in xIrcMessageFrame widget that were
   used  to  display the widget each time a new messages was recieved.
   This was needed to correct for the behavior of the QDialog class in
   the  new  qt-0.94  release where it centered a dialog object on the
   screen on every call to show().

   Fixed xIrcMsgQuery object to signal back the entire message when it
   was  done so the message could be placed into the window of the new
   frame by xIrcConnect

-------------------------------------------------------
    1.11
